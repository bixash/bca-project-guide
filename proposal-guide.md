## Things to note:
•	List of abbreviation, abstract, table and figures is optional for proposal.     
•	All figure captions should start with “1.1” in proposal as there is no chapter in proposal.   
•	Page margins should be in inches top 1, bottom 1, left 1.25 and right 1.      
•	Follow the project report guideline for paragraph, page numbering, font, layout and spacing.  

## 1.	Introduction 
Introduce about your project with some context and background.
## 2.	Problem statement 
Mention the main problem your project going to solve, don’t use vague and ambiguous term, be more specific and precise.
Boil it down in simple two points.
## 3.	Objectives 
List the objectives of your project, don’t list more than two.
## 4.	Methodology
### A.	Requirement Identification 
#### I.	Study of Existing System 
Explain the system you’ve studied for this preparation of the project
#### II.	Literature Review 
Mention the literature that you reviewed from such as research papers, conference papers, journals, articles etc. Most of your citation must be included here. 
#### III.	Requirement Analysis 
Functional and non-functional requirements of your project must be listed here. Use-case diagram must be after functional requirement section.
### B.	Feasibility Study 
#### I.	Technical 
Why this project is technically feasible?
#### II.	Operational 
Why this project is operationally feasible?
#### III.	Economic 
Why this project is operationally feasible?
### C.	High Level Design of System 	
#### I.	Methodology of the proposed system
Mention the software methodology your project is going to use; waterfall methodology is appropriate for most of the project if it involves less than two people as project time is limited. Don’t include deployment phase.
#### II.	System Flowchart
System flowchart diagram and describe it
#### III.	Working Mechanism of Proposed System
Diagram of working mechanism of the system and describe it.
#### IV.	Description of Algorithms (if any)
Write down the algorithm of your project, this section is optional for 4th semester project but compulsory for 6th semester project.
## 5.	Gantt Chart (showing the project timeline) 
Diagram of working schedule with specific date timeline.
## 6.	Expected outcome
Write project objective here with future tense.
## References
References should be in IEEE format.
